      - Focus on preserving beneficials to avoid rapid rebounds.

38:
  name: "maize ear rot"
  summary: "Harvest and dry promptly, use resistant hybrids and manage kernel moisture to prevent mold development."
  details: |
    Symptoms:
      - Rotting of kernels in ear; discoloration, often associated with high moisture or insect damage.
    Cultural controls:
      - Timely harvest and proper drying; manage insect damage to ears; remove infected cobs.
    Biological controls:
      - Post-harvest biological control limited; focus on good storage practices.
    Chemical controls:
      - Fungicide seed treatments and field sprays as recommended for specific pathogens and under advisement.
    Monitoring:
      - Inspect ears at R stages; reduce moisture at harvest and during storage.
    Notes:
      - Grain quality and storage handling critical to prevent mycotoxin issues.

39:
  name: "maize fall armyworm"
  summary: "Early detection, use biopesticides (Bt), targeted insecticides, and field sanitation."
  details: |
    Symptoms:
      - Windowing of leaves, frass in whorl/ears, severe defoliation if unchecked.
    Cultural controls:
      - Early planting and field sanitation reduce outbreaks; remove alternate hosts.
    Biological controls:
      - Use parasitoids, predators and biopesticides (Bt, NPV) where effective.
    Chemical controls:
      - Apply selective insecticides targeting early larval stages; rotate modes of action to prevent resistance.
    Monitoring:
      - Use pheromone traps and regular scouting (whorl/ear checks).
    Notes:
      - Area-wide coordination improves control outcomes.

40:
  name: "maize stem borer"
  summary: "Use pheromone traps, resistant hybrids, cultural practices and targeted insecticides."
  details: |
    Symptoms:
      - Deadheart, tunneling inside stems, broken tassels and lodging.
    Cultural controls:
      - Remove and destroy stubbles and residues; timely planting and harvesting; intercropping reduces pressure.
    Biological controls:
      - Encourage parasitoids and predators; granular biocontrols may help in early stages.
    Chemical controls:
      - Use stem-applied or systemic insecticides where recommended and at the right crop stage.
    Monitoring:
      - Pheromone traps and scouting for larvae/pupal damage.
    Notes:
      - Integrated measures are most effective long-term.

41:
  name: "pink bollworm in cotton"
  summary: "Use pheromone traps, Bt varieties, cultural sanitation and targeted chemicals if required."
  details: |
    Symptoms:
      - Larvae bore into bolls; lint and seed damage; webbing inside bolls.
    Cultural controls:
      - Sanitation (destroy crop residues), crop rotation and avoid late-season host presence.
    Biological controls:
      - Release of natural enemies where feasible and Bt-based controls.
    Chemical controls:
      - Use pheromone disruption, targeted insecticides at early stages under threshold guidance.
    Monitoring:
      - Pheromone traps critical to detect adult flights and time interventions.
    Notes:
      - Area-wide integrated pest management effective.

42:
  name: "red cotton bug"
  summary: "Hand-pick, improve field sanitation, and use insecticides if population high."
  details: |
    Symptoms:
      - Feeding punctures on bolls, staining and fibre quality reduction.
    Cultural controls:
      - Remove weed hosts and infested residues; improve harvest timing to avoid peak populations.
    Biological controls:
      - Conserve predators; few commercial biocontrol options.
    Chemical controls:
      - Apply registered insecticides if thresholds exceeded; follow label directions.
    Monitoring:
      - Regular inspection of bolls; treat early to prevent quality loss.
    Notes:
      - Prevention and clean fields reduce risk.
